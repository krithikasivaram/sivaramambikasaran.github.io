## Sample Research

1. ### Fast Linear Algebra Algorithms
	The major focus of the group is to reduce the computational complexity of linear algebra algorithms at the same time maintaining high accuracy.
	
	* #### Dense linear algebra
	Typically, linear algebra algorithms for dense matrix vector products scale as ùí™(*N*<sup>2</sup>) and for solving dense linear systems scale as ùí™(*N*<sup>3</sup>), where the underlying matrix is of size *N*‚ÄÖ√ó‚ÄÖ*N*. This is excruciatingly slow for large-scale practical problems, making it unattractive for large-scale simulation needed for optimization and design. However, note that since most of the computation is done in finite precision (say machine precision of 16 digits), we can devise approximate but arbitrarily accurate numerical algorithms, that scales favorably and guaranteeing high precision.

	<img src="H2D_level_4.jpg" alt="H2D_level_4" width="250">
	</center>

	* #### Sparse linear algebra
	To solve partial differential equations, discretizing the PDE using finite difference or finite element method is preferred in practice. Such discretizations result in a sparse linear system, which needs to be solved. Solving the corresponding linear system of size *N*‚ÄÖ√ó‚ÄÖ*N* using nested dissection or multifrontal strategies requires a computational cost of ùí™(*N*<sup>(*d*+1)/2</sup>), where *d* is the underlying dimension. Our focus is on reducing these computational costs to ùí™(*N*) guaranteeing high precision.

2. ### Design Centric PDE Solvers
	One major application focus of our group is on designing accurate, fast ODE solvers for a wide range of applications, for instance, electromagnetic scattering from penetrable and impenetrable objects, advance stealth applications, material homogenization, imaging, etc. Traditional solvers have been mainly based on iterative techniques, which has its own set of disadvantages. For instance, the number of iterations to converge may be extremely large making it impractical. Another disadvantage, especially for design, is that any modifciation to the geometry or incoming field typically results in restarting the entire iterative solver, which is definitely not desirable. To circumvent these disadvantages, our focus is to design high accurate and fast *direct* solvers for such systems.

3. ### Computational Statistics
	One of the core issues in computational statistics and large scale data analysis is efficient manipulation of dense covariance matrices, which describe the interdependence between several random variables or random processes. This is especially the case in spatial statistics and time series. In the previously mentioned contexts, the correlation matrices have a highly exploitable structure.

4. ### Black-box tools, reproducible and open source computational science
	There are several implementations of the fast multipole method and fast direct solvers, but very few provide standalone implementations or the basic ``building blocks" that can be easily re-used. One of our focus is to develop such standalone implementations, which will be of use in many other applications. Another endeavor is to have the tools for computational science available to the public as open source standalone numerical libraries. To this end, we maintain a GitHub repository(https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran) and a GitLab repository (https://gitlab.com/groups/SAFRAN), where all the numerical packages, which include fast multipole method, fast direct solvers, quadratures, etc., developed by us are posted and made available to the public.
