<span style="color:lime">``There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge." -- Bertrand Russell</span>

Much (if not all) of this Blog is a collection of useless stuff. A full listing of my blog posts follows.

### <a href="./notes">Notes</a>

A collection of some of my notes. Some of them were written for teaching purposes, while others were written for entertainment. In case you find any blunders/errors/typos/grammatical mistakes (however small or big it might be), I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know.

### <a href="./quotes">Quotes</a>

A collection of some interesting quotes

### <a href="./others">Others</a>

Other random things under the sun
